         <p id="about-blurb">Hello! My name is Ashe. I'm a front-end web developer, and I usually work in JavaScript. When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time reading, sewing or doing crafts, and playing video games.
        <br><br>
        I have an academic background in visual arts before I learned how to build websites. Even though I never ended up pursuing the visual arts, I did learn skills that I was able to carry into my web design.
        <br><br>
        Alongside coding, two of my favorite things in the world are storytelling and my beautifly strange cat. I hope to be a prolific author someday. Please enjoy this picture of my cat, Jake.
